"""Pre-cloud Leakage Adversary.

Pipeline:  analyzer -> detector -> sanitizer -> [leakage_adversary] -> gate
Reads:     policy, sanitized_chunks
Writes:    verdict, safe

The trust-boundary probe: it attacks the sanitized context for residual PII and
quasi-identifiers before anything leaves for the cloud answer model. It runs one
adversarial probe per configured attack vector, keeps the strongest signal, and
treats a probe whose confidence reaches the threshold as a leak. On a leak it
also emits a PII-free remediation report the analyzer applies like human gate
feedback: which engine, strategy, threshold, or entity labels to change.
